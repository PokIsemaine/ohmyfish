# Lab8 Memory allocator

## 要求

The program user/kalloctest stresses xv6's memory allocator: three processes grow and shrink their address spaces, resulting in many calls to `kalloc` and `kfree`. `kalloc` and `kfree` obtain `kmem.lock`. kalloctest prints (as "#fetch-and-add") the number of loop iterations in `acquire` due to attempts to acquire a lock that another core already holds, for the `kmem` lock and a few other locks. The number of loop iterations in `acquire` is a rough measure of lock contention. The output of `kalloctest` looks similar to this before you complete the lab:

```
$ kalloctest
start test1
test1 results:
--- lock kmem/bcache stats
lock: kmem: #fetch-and-add 83375 #acquire() 433015
lock: bcache: #fetch-and-add 0 #acquire() 1260
--- top 5 contended locks:
lock: kmem: #fetch-and-add 83375 #acquire() 433015
lock: proc: #fetch-and-add 23737 #acquire() 130718
lock: virtio_disk: #fetch-and-add 11159 #acquire() 114
lock: proc: #fetch-and-add 5937 #acquire() 130786
lock: proc: #fetch-and-add 4080 #acquire() 130786
tot= 83375
test1 FAIL
```

`acquire` maintains, for each lock, the count of calls to `acquire` for that lock, and the number of times the loop in `acquire` tried but failed to set the lock. kalloctest calls a system call that causes the kernel to print those counts for the kmem and bcache locks (which are the focus of this lab) and for the 5 most contended locks. If there is lock contention the number of `acquire` loop iterations will be large. The system call returns the sum of the number of loop iterations for the kmem and bcache locks.

For this lab, you must use a dedicated unloaded machine with multiple cores. If you use a machine that is doing other things, the counts that kalloctest prints will be nonsense. You can use a dedicated Athena workstation, or your own laptop, but don't use a dialup machine.

The root cause of lock contention in kalloctest is that `kalloc()` has a single free list, protected by a single lock. To remove lock contention, you will have to redesign the memory allocator to avoid a single lock and list. The basic idea is to maintain a free list per CPU, each list with its own lock. Allocations and frees on different CPUs can run in parallel, because each CPU will operate on a different list. The main challenge will be to deal with the case in which one CPU's free list is empty, but another CPU's list has free memory; in that case, the one CPU must "steal" part of the other CPU's free list. Stealing may introduce lock contention, but that will hopefully be infrequent.

Your job is to implement per-CPU freelists, and stealing when a CPU's free list is empty. You must give all of your locks names that start with "kmem". That is, you should call `initlock` for each of your locks, and pass a name that starts with "kmem". Run kalloctest to see if your implementation has reduced lock contention. To check that it can still allocate all of memory, run `usertests sbrkmuch`. Your output will look similar to that shown below, with much-reduced contention in total on kmem locks, although the specific numbers will differ. Make sure all tests in `usertests` pass. `make grade` should say that the kalloctests pass.

```
$ kalloctest

--- lock kmem/bcache stats

```

Some hints:

- You can use the constant `NCPU` from kernel/param.h
- Let `freerange` give all free memory to the CPU running `freerange`.
- The function `cpuid` returns the current core number, but it's only safe to call it and use its result when interrupts are turned off. You should use `push_off()` and `pop_off()` to turn interrupts off and on.
- Have a look at the `snprintf` function in kernel/sprintf.c for string formatting ideas. It is OK to just name all locks "kmem" though.
